{Woman's name} awoke one { time of day} feeling rather

{feeling/emotion}, and not only that, her {body part} was

{adjective} and touching her {body part}. She

fanned her {fruit}, wiped the sweat from her

{body part} and realized there was only one explanation.

She was only {number} years old and she was facing

menopause. To be sure she {adverb} made her way to the

{room} and jumped on (the) {noun}. Ah ha!

Just as she suspected, she was {number} pounds heavier

than the night before and there were {number} new

wrinkles on her {body part}. Her emotions began to swing

{adverb} from {feeling/emotion} to {feeling/emotion}.

She needed (a) {a comfort food} ASAP! And where was the phone?

She had to call the {professional} to do something about her

{-ing verb}. No answer! {exclamation} she screamed

before falling on the {furniture} in a fit of tears.

{number} minutes later she didn't remember a thing till

her {body part} began to cramp and and a(n)

{something cold}-like chill made her {body part} quiver.

Someone was going to pay for this and might as well be

{woman's significant other or a friend}.
